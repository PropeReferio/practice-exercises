# Python Crash Course 6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places.
# Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three 
# favorite places for each person . To make this exercise a bit more interesting, 
# ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places . Loop through the 
# dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places .
